            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Roasted broccoli is really easy to make and more flavorful than boiled.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>14 ounces of broccoli</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
                    <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Cut the broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice it into 1/4-inch slices.</li>
                    <li>Mix the broccoli florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the mixture to a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Roast the broccoli in the preheated oven until it is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
